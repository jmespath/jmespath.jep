# Abstract
[abstract]: #abstract

A brief one paragraph description of what's being proposed.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Describe why this feature is needed in JMESPath.  What are examples
of querying JSON documents that aren't possible unless JMESPath
adds support for this feature.

JEPs that do not have sufficient motivation or interest will not be
accepted no matter how well written the proposal is or how simple
the feature may be.  Use this section to make a compelling case why
JMESPath needs this feature.


# Specification
[specification]: #specification

Write this section as if you were adding it to the existing
JMESPath spec, which is what will happen if the JEP is accepted.

The following subsections are optional, and can be omitted if
they do not apply.


## Grammar Updates

If you are proposing changes to the language itself, you must provide
the relevant ABNF updates to the grammar of the language.  Any new
grammar rules as well as any modifications to existing grammar rules.


# Rationale
[rationale]: #rationale

This section is used to explain why the proposed specification is the
best way to achieve the desired functionality.  This is different from
the motivation section which explains why the feature should exist.

You can add additional subsections as you feel necessary.  Common
subsections here include:

* Alternatives considered.  Why were all the alternative designs that
  were considered not chosen?  What makes the proposed design of this
  feature the best option?
* Tradeoffs made for this feature.
* Open and/or unresolved issues with the design.
* FAQ of anticipated review questions.  If you anticipate specific
  feedback from JEP reviewers you can add a FAQ subsection to help
  streamline the review process.

# Test Cases
[testcases]: #testcases

Add test cases that use the test schema in the [jmespath.test](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.test)
repo.  If the JEP is accepted, these test cases will be copied over to the
jmespath.test repo.
